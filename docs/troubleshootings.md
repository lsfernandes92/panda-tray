## Application icon not showing in system tray

If the app's icon does not appear in the system tray (menu bar) on MacOS, ensure that the image used for the icon is properly resized. Resize the image to the recommended size (typically **16x16, 32x32, or 64x64** pixels in PNG format) before running the app.
