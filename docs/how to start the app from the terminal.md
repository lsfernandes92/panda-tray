# How to start the app from the terminal

## Starting an application from the terminal in macOS

> [!NOTE]
> Running the following commands eliminates the need to install the application via GUI, preventing the app from appearing on the `Applications` folder, therefore the need of installing and reinstalling each time something changes ðŸ‘Œ

The common approach is to use the `open` command:

```bash
open /path/to/YourApp.app
```

## Starting the Pandinhe application

When the packages was generated by the third-party tool (`npm run dist`). Run the following:

```bash
open dist/mac-arm64/Pandinhe.app
```

Or when the packages was generated using Electron Forge (`npm run make`). Run the following:

```bash
open out/Pandinhe-darwin-arm64/Pandinhe.app 
```
